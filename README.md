### Hey everyone! üëã
As a dedicated software engineer at team.it, I specialize in crafting robust applications utilizing a diverse tech stack including Java EE, CDI, EJB, Hibernate, SQL, Informix 4GL and relational databases like Oracle and Postgres. My expertise extends to implementing REST architecture and leveraging frontend tools such as Angular, HTML, and CSS.

With a fervent passion for collaboration, I thrive in environments where I can work closely with fellow developers, testers, and clients to deliver bespoke software solutions that exceed expectations and fulfill objectives.

Prior to my tenure at team.it, I honed my interpersonal skills and business acumen as a sales representative at MB Ind. Mec√¢nica. Through this experience, I cultivated strong communication, negotiation, and relationship-building abilities that continue to enrich my approach to project management and client interaction.

Currently pursuing a degree in An√°lise e Desenvolvimento de Sistemas at Centro Universit√°rio IBMR, I am committed to staying at the forefront of emerging technologies and concepts, continuously expanding my skill set to drive innovation and excellence in my work.

Passionate about exploring the intricacies of different domains and their behaviors, I view technology as a boundless universe of possibilities and bridges, connecting diverse worlds and propelling progress.

Let's connect and explore opportunities to collaborate and innovate together. üíª

Always looking for new learnings and technologies. Open mind to learn more.
